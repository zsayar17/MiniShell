# MiniShell
This repository presents a comprehensive re-implementation of a mini version of a Bash shell, designed to offer essential functionality found in a typical Unix shell. It features a set of built-in functions including 'cd,' 'echo,' 'export,' 'env,' and more, making it a versatile and self-contained command-line environment.

What sets this project apart is its commitment to code quality and readability. The codebase is meticulously crafted, adhering to best practices, and following a clear and intuitive structure. It follows a well-defined lexer->expander->parser->executor pathway, which not only enhances code maintainability but also offers a valuable learning resource for those seeking to understand the inner workings of a shell.

Furthermore, this project goes beyond basic functionality by incorporating multiprocess handling. This addition not only demonstrates the practical implementation of multiprocess support but also provides a performance boost for executing commands efficiently.
 
In summary, this repository not only offers a functional shell but also serves as an educational and well-structured codebase for those interested in shell scripting and Unix-like environments.
